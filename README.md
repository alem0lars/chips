# Chips

Useful tiny scripts, which aren't big enough to be single standalone projects.

## Structure

* [`gnulinux`](./gnulinux): Scripts for all types of `GNU/Linux`es (no distro-specific).
* [`gentoo`](./gentoo): Scripts specific for `Gentoo`-based systems.
* [`osx`](./osx): Scripts specific for `OSX`.
