# Chips

Useful tiny scripts, which aren't big enough to be single standalone projects.

## Usage

You can directly use the chips by running them.

I strongly suggest you to setup them into your system, making them convenient to use.

Run the setup script:

```shellsession
$ ./setup
```

*The setup script will prompt you some questions to choose and tune the chips to suit your needs.*

## Structure

Chips are divided by category:

* [`gnulinux`](./scripts/gnulinux): Chips for all types of `GNU/Linux`es (no distro-specific).
* [`gentoo`](./scripts/gentoo): Chips specific for `Gentoo`-based systems.
* [`osx`](./scripts/osx): Chips specific for `OSX`.
* [`jee`](./scripts/jee): Chips for `Java Enterprise Edition`.
